### About

**sidekick** is a free and open-source game framework under the [MIT license](LICENSE) that allows developers to create stunning 2D video games, prototypes, desktop apps and everything in between. It uses [glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin) for window context management and [rgx](https://github.com/cloudhead/rgx) as the rendering engine.

**sidekick** is subject to change as it is actively developed so expect things to break (üòÖ).

**sidekick** is an educational project for learning purposes, feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects, just keep in mind that support is minimal.

Supported platforms:

### Contributing

**sidekick** is completely open to community contribution. Any effort to help expand the scope and capability of the framework is greatly appreciated ü§ó.

### Requirements

- Rust compiler and Cargo package manager, you can download them [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- A code editor of your choice.

---

### Getting Started

To create a basic sidekick app:

1. Create a new project with Cargo using `cargo new project-name --bin`.

2. In your `Cargo.toml`, add:

```rust
        [dependencies]
        sidekick = { git = "https://github.com/ThaiDuongVu/sidekick" }
```

3. In your `main.rs`, add:
```rust
        use sidekick::app::App;

        fn main() {
            // Create a sidekick app
            let app = App::new();
            
            // Initialize app before first frame update
            // Note: Dynamic environment should be initialized outside of init
            let init = move |app: &mut App| {};
            
            // Update and render game objects every frame
            let update = move |app: &mut App| {};

            // Run app
            app.run(init, update);
        }
```

4. Build and run the project with `cargo run`.

5. You should see the following window by default:

### Tutorials and Documentation

You can refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/ThaiDuongVu/sidekick/wiki) (whenever it's live ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for an in-depth guide to **sidekick**.

There are a handful of [examples](./examples) to learn from. To run them simply run the command `cargo run --example example-name` where `example-name` is, well, the name of the example to run.

---

### Want a feature that's currently not in sidekick's roadmap?

Well first of all you can implement it yourself (the power of open source üòè).

You can also go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/ThaiDuongVu/sidekick/issues) and submit a new issue (remember to add the "feature request" label).
