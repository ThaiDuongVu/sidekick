### About

**sidekick** is a free and open-source game framework under the [MIT license](LICENSE) that allows developers to create stunning 2D video games, desktop apps and everything in between. It uses [glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin) for window context management and [rgx](https://github.com/cloudhead/rgx) as the rendering engine.

**sidekick** supports Windows, Linux and macOS (although untested properly on macOS, sorry I don't have a mac üòì).

**sidekick** is subject to change as it is actively developed so expect things to break (üòÖ).

**sidekick** is an educational project for learning purposes, feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects, just keep in mind that support is minimal.

### Requirements

- Rust compiler and Cargo package manager, you can download them [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- A code editor of your choice.

### Getting Started

To create a basic sidekick app:

1. Create a new project with Cargo using `cargo new project-name --bin`.

2. In your `Cargo.toml`, add:

```rust
        [dependencies]
        sidekick = { git = "https://github.com/ThaiDuongVu/sidekick" }
```

3. In your `main.rs`, add:
```rust
        use sidekick::app::App;

        fn main() {
            // Intialize before first frame update
            let init = move |_app: &mut App| {};
            // Update once every frame
            let update = move |_app: &mut App| {};
            // Render game objects
            let render = move |_app: &mut App| {};
            // Clean up before game exit
            let exit = move |_app: &mut App| {};

            let app = App::new();
            app.run(init, update, render, exit);
        }

```

4. Build and run the project with `cargo run`.

5. You should see the following window by default:
