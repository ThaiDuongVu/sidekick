### About

**sidekick** is a free and open-source game framework under the [MIT license](LICENSE) that will allow developers to create stunning 2D video games, desktop apps and everything in between. It uses [glutin](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin) for window context management and Vulkan as the rendering backend (the Vulkan side is not yet implemented).

**sidekick** supports Windows, Linux and macOS (although untested properly on macOS).

**sidekick** is subject to change as it is actively developed so expect things to break every now and then (sorry about that üòÖ).

**sidekick** is an education project for learning purposes, feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects, just keep in mind that support is minimal.

### Getting Started

To create a basic sidekick app:

1. Create a new project with Cargo by typing `cargo new project-name --bin`.

2. In your `Cargo.toml`, add:

```rust
        [dependencies]
        sidekick = { git = "https://github.com/ThaiDuongVu/sidekick" }
```

3. In your `main.rs`, add:
```rust
        use sidekick::app::App;

        fn main() {
            let app = App::new();
            app.run(None, None, None, None);
        }
```

4. Build and run the project with `cargo run`.

5. You should see the following window by default:
